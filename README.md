## Instructions
1. Sign up for a GitHub account at [github.com][github-join].
	- If your username doesnâ€™t contain your name, put your real name in your profile so that robotics members can identify you more easily ([example][twotau-account]). It doesn't have to be a full name - `nhazra` or `vishald` would work fine.
2. Request to join the [Spartabots organization][spartabots-organization] on GitHub.
3. Fork, then clone your fork of [this repository][this-repo].
4. Add your username and any information you want us to know about you to the list in `people.txt`, following the example.
5. Commit to your fork and submit a pull request to this repository. We should accept your request pretty quickly.
